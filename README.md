# Comparison of Microbial Communities Between Artisanal and Mass-produced Cheeses via Metagenomic Sequencing  


All files apart from Data Trim are shell files used for QIMME analysis of data. 
Data Trim is various VBA & Python functions I used to reformat data and filter it using a colour matrix to assign progress to workflow. Other functions were used alongside those listed in data trim but they were not explicitly renamed for this project so have weird names so  I have not uplaoded them. If you would like me to spend time renaming them and uploading them I can do so, please just let me know. Most can be found in the COMP0015 repository.
